Insurance policies usually have:
- Dense clauses
- Nested bullet points
- Tables for benefits / exclusions
- Footnotes and cross-references (“see Section 4.2(b)”)

Tips:
- Chunking strategy matters more than usual
- Chunk by section / heading, not just character count
- Keep tables as single chunks instead of splitting them
- (You don’t need to implement this immediately — just don’t panic if answers feel off early.)
- Retrieval matters more than the LLM here. Wrong retrieval → confidently wrong answer 😬

Future-you might experiment with:
- Top-k tuning (how many chunks retrieved)
- Smaller chunks for definitions
- Larger chunks for exclusions / coverage sections

Guardrails are actually important for this use case as insurance is a high-trust domain.:
- Asking the model to quote the policy in its answer
- Having it say “I can’t find this in your policy” instead of guessing
- Explicitly stating “This is not legal advice” (portfolio brownie points 🍪)

This is more prompting than architecture — so your stack is still fine.

UX consideration (very underrated, very impressive):
- Let users ask: “Am I covered for X?” “What are the exclusions for Y?”
- And respond with:
| -- Answer 
| -- Relevant clause(s)
| -- Page number / section title
- Versioning documents (optional but classy) since policies change
| -- Policy version / date metadata; ability to say: “This answer is based on Policy v2023.1”
